<h1 align="center">Discord Quote Sender</h1>
<a align="center">Below are some stuff you will need :)</a>

-----------------------------------------------------

<details>
  <summary>How does this work?</summary>
  You change the Webhook URL in source/quotesender.py, and the quotes.
  It sends the quotes in a loop to that webhook, with a timer.
  The timer can be customized.
  When it's closed, the loop will end.
</details>



<details>
  <summary>How do i run this?</summary>
  Download the file in source [the folder!], run it (with python and with all the modules installed!), and wait.
  You can put it on a cloud service for 24/7 hosting.
